    <td>Description: A simulated and real PR2 robot are teleoperated by non-experts through a crowd-sourcing web-based 3d-viewer-controller to manipulate objects, and a deep learning model is trained to learn this data (point cloud, language, trajectory). The goal: Many differently-shaped objects share similarly-operated object parts; thus, the goal is to evaluate if the manipulation trajectory of an object can be transferred to a completely different object if they share similarly-operated parts (116 RGB-D point-clouds, 1225 trajectories, 250 language instructions by 71 non-experts). Found issues: Were trajectories completely transferred? Yes for 60%. Were the object manipulation the actual correct one? No guarantee, but the results showed it was achieved for a large fraction of objects which the robot has never seen before. Is crowd-sourcing teaching possible? Yes, crowd-sourced non-experts performed at 60%, compared to 53.1% by experts</td>

    <td> Description: A Baxter robot is teleoperated and controlled through ROS reality and Unity-based HTC-vive reality system. The human and robot share a virtual space, but are not superimposed (The humans is around the robot). The goal: This work evaluated twelve complex tasks and measured whether they were succesfully achieved with this robot and software, and whether they could be teleoperated. Found issues: more precision for block stacking through VR, robot force or end-effector deficiencies, not knowing robot posses limitations through ROS reality. Benefits: They argue that teleoperation could be a solution to the problem of gathering data for learning from demonstration.</td>
